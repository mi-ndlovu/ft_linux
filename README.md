This is not about Kernel programming, but itâ€™s highly related.

# Goals
1) Build a Linux Kernel.
2) Install some binaries.
3) Implement a filesystem hierarchy compliant with the standards.
4) Connect to the Internet.

This distro will be the base for all my kernel projects, because all my
kernel-code will be executed here, on my distro.
